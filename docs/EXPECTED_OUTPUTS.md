### Complexity Filtering Examples

With `complexity-threshold: 30`:
- Would include tasks with complexity ‚â§ 30
- Most tasks would be included
- Very complex tasks (complexity 35+) would be excluded

With `complexity-threshold: 50`:
- Would include all tasks
- No filtering applied

With `complexity-threshold: 20`:
- Would exclude high-complexity tasks
- Only simpler, more granular tasks included

```

### Complexity Threshold Exceeded
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tasks Filtered by Complexity

### Summary
- **Total Tasks Generated**: 15
- **Tasks Above Threshold**: 8
- **Tasks Included**: 7
- **Complexity Threshold**: 30

## Integration with GitHub Features

### Sub-issue Relationships
Tasks are linked using GitHub's Sub-issues API:
- Parent tasks show child tasks in the issue sidebar
- Child tasks display parent task references
- Hierarchy is maintained through GitHub's native features

### Automated Labels
- `task`: Applied to all generated issues
- `blocked`: Applied when dependencies are not complete
- `priority:high/medium/low`: Based on task priority analysis
- `complexity:high/medium/low`: Based on complexity scores
- Custom labels: Based on task content and categories

### Issue Templates
Generated issues follow a consistent template:
- YAML front-matter with metadata
- Structured description with technical details
- Dependency tracking with checkboxes
- Meta information section
- Consistent formatting and organization

This documentation provides a comprehensive view of what users can expect when using the Taskmaster Issues Generator with different types of PRD files and configurations.
